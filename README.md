# Classification-of-Sperm-Abnormality-with-EfficientNetV2-Method-and-Dynamic-Color-Image-Processing
This project applies the EfficientNetV2 method for classifying sperm abnormalities using dynamic color image processing. It is designed to assist in medical and reproductive health research by accurately identifying sperm morphology abnormalities from microscopic images.
